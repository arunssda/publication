Text-independent speech balloon segmentation for comics and manga
===============================================
   
Abstract
------------------------------------------------
Comics and manga are one of the most popular and familiar forms of graphic content over the world and play a major role in spreading country's culture. Nowadays, massive digitization and digital-born materials allow page-per-page mobile reading but we believe that other usages may be released in the near future. In this paper we focus on speech balloon segmentation which is a key issue for text/graphic association in scanned and digital-born comic book images. Speech balloons are at the interface between text and comic character, they inform the reader about speech tone and the position of its speaker. We present a generic and text-independent segmentation method based on topological and spatial organization of connected components.
