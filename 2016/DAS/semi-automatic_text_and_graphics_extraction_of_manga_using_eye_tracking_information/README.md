Semi-automatic Text and Graphics Extraction of Manga using Eye Tracking Information
===============================================
   
Abstract
------------------------------------------------
The popularity of storing and distributing comic books electronically, together with the trend of reading them on various types of devices, has made the task of comics analysis an interesting research problem.
Different work have been carried out aiming at understanding the layout structure and the graphic content. However the results are still far from universally applicable, largely due to the huge variety in expression styles and in the page arrangement, especially in manga (Japanese comics). 
In this paper, we propose an online comic image analysis approach by gathering eye-tracking data recorded during manga reading sessions. As humans are extremely capable of interpreting the drawing content and their eye movements show distinguishable patterns over text or graphic region,
the eye gaze data can add rich information to the understanding of the image content.
Experimental results show that the eye gaze fixations and saccades indeed form consistent patterns among readers, and can be used for manga textual and graphical analysis.
