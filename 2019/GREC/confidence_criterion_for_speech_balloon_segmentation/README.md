Confidence criterion for speech balloon segmentation
===============================================
   
Abstract
------------------------------------------------
This short paper investigates how to improve the confidence of speech balloon segmentation algorithms
from comic book images. It comes from the need of precise indications about the quality of automatic processing in order to accept or not each segmented regions as a valid result, according to the application and without requiring any ground truth. We discuss several applications like result quality assessment for companies and automatic ground truth creation from high confidence results to train machine learning based
systems.We present some ideas to combine several domain knowledge information (e.g. shape, text, etc.) and produce an improved confidence criterion.
