Speech balloon contour classification in comics
===============================================
   
Abstract
------------------------------------------------
Comic books digitization combined with subsequent
comic book understanding create a variety of new applications,
including mobile reading and data mining. Document understand-
ing in this domain is challenging as comics are semi-structured
documents, combining semantically important graphical and
textual parts. In this work we detail a novel approach for
classifying speech balloon in scanned comics book pages based
on their contour time series.
