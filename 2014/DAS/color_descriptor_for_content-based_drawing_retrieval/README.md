Color descriptor for content-based drawing retrieval
===============================================
   
Abstract
------------------------------------------------
Human detection in computer vision field is an
active field of research. Extending this to human-like drawings
such as the main characters in comic book stories is not
trivial. Comics analysis is a very recent field of research at the
intersection of graphics, texts, objects and people recognition.
The detection of the main comic characters is an essential step
towards a fully automatic comic book understanding. This paper
presents a color-based approach for comics character retrieval
using content-based drawing retrieval and color palette.
